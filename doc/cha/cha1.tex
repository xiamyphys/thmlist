\chapter{The \pkg{LiteBook} Template}

\section{The purpose of this package}

This template provides a fresh cover and chapter design for book. Welcome to feedback bugs or ideas via email \href{mailto:xiamyphys@gmail.com}{\ttfamily xiamyphys@gmail.com} or \href{https://github.com/xiamyphys/litebook}{GitHub}.

This template is used by me to reformat the textbook \href{https://github.com/xiamyphys/LaTeX-General-Relativity-R.Wald}{\emph{General Relativity, R. Wald}}, and I also use this template to typesetting my notes on \href{https://github.com/xiamyphys/Group-Theory-in-Physics}{\emph{Group Theory in Physics}}. You can download their codes on \href{https://github.com/xiamyphys}{GitHub}.

\section{Installing \pkg{LiteBook} and loading it}

For portable version, simply download latest \verb|litebook.cls| file from \href{https://github.com/xiamyphys/LiteBook}{GitHub} or \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/litebook}{CTAN} and save it under your working directory. This way of installation is simple and convenient, but you have to manually update \verb|.cls| now and then.

However, I strongly suggest that you should use terminal/cmd to implement the commands to update all the packages (and install this package) to the latest version or switch to portable version instead
\begin{verbatim}
    sudo tlmgr update --self --all
\end{verbatim}

If you are in some areas with awful Internet environment (such as GFW), you can choose a proper mirror source or use other means\footnote{Please comply with local network regulations.}. To learn more, please refer to \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55437/how-do-i-update-my-tex-distribution}{How do I update my \hologo{TeX} distribution?}

\section{Compatibility}

The test environments are macOS + Mac\hologo{TeX} 2024 / Overleaf and they all work fine for \hologo{pdfLaTeX} and \hologo{XeLaTeX} compilers. Windows, Linux and Unix platforms' unknown. The compile time of current document via \hologo{pdfLaTeX} compiler is \verb|0.965Â±0.0019s| on \textsf{MacBook Air M2 8GB (macOS Sonoma 14.4)} when charging.

\section{Cover Information Settings}

There are several lines of information and a cover image on the cover of this document, the corresponding commands are the following

\begin{verbatim}
    \cover{\UPLOWFadingImage[trim={0 {.9\paperheight} 0 0},clip]{cover}
                            [trim={0 {.5\paperheight} 0 0},clip]{cover}}
    \title{\scshape The \pkg{LiteBook} Template}
    \subtitle{Version 0.2a \today}        \author{Hsia Mingyu}
    \bioinfo{Hangzhou Dianzi University}
    \press{\scshape The University of Chicago Press}
\end{verbatim}

The same as the \pkg{book} class, the command \cmd{title} could not be omitted, or it will return an error, and there will be a warning if the command \cmd{author} is omitted. The \cmd{cover} can assign the format of the image on the cover and you can adjust the format of the image with the \pkg{fadingimage} package.

\section{Global options of this template}

\begin{verbatim}
    \documentclass[<math>,<thmstyle>]{litebook}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \mode{math} option can set the math font to be \mode{newtx} (default) or \mode{mtpro2}.
    \item The \mode{thmstyle} option can set the style of \pkg{amsthm} environments be the \pkg{mdframed} (default) or \pkg{amsthm}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preset packages and commands}

This template has been preset with the following packages:
\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l}
        \toprule
        \pkg{amsthm} & \pkg{bm} & \pkg{cancel} & \pkg{derivative} & \pkg{esvect} & \pkg{extarrows} & \pkg{fixdif} & \pkg{nicefrac}\\
        \midrule
        \pkg{nicematrix} & \pkg{physics2} & \pkg{refstyle} & \pkg{siunitx} & \pkg{booktabs} & \pkg{diagbox} & \pkg{fontawesome5} & \pkg{geometry}\\
        \midrule
        \pkg{indentfirst} & \pkg{mdframed} & \pkg{multicol} & \pkg{multirow} & \pkg{setspace} & \pkg{tabularx} & \pkg{tcolorbox} & \pkg{tikz}\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can click on them to go to the homepage to view the documentation.

And commands \verb|\i|, \verb|\e|, \verb|\T| have been defined to input 
$\i$, $\e$ in roman (non-italic) text and matrix transpose symbol $\T$, which can help you typeset math quickly.

The template has been preset the following reference command via \pkg{refstyle} package: \verb|\eqref{<label>}|, \verb|\figref{<label>}| and \verb|\tabref{<label>}|, you can add other ref commands via \pkg{refstyle} package.

\section{Equation Test}

The following is the Schr\"odinger Equation
\begin{equation}
    \i\hbar\pdv{}t\Psi(x,t)=\ab[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x,t)]\Psi(x,t)
\end{equation}

The above equations are the integral formula of the Maxwell's Equations in Gaussian units.

\section{Figure and Caption Side by Side Test}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{minipage}{.32\textwidth}

    \end{tikzpicture}

Here, \figref{1.1} is a diagram showing the causal structure of spacetime in special relativity.

\section{Preset Environments}

\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{<theoremname>} ... \end{<theoremname>}   \begin{axiom} ... \end{axiom}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{definition}[The Definition Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: A definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and is not.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[The Theorem Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: A theorem is a statement that has been proved, or can be proved.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}[The Lemma Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: In mathematics, informal logic and argument mapping, a lemma (pl.: lemmas or lemmata) is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result. For that reason, it is also known as a ``helping theorem'' or an ``auxiliary theorem''.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}[The Corollary Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: A corollary is a theorem of less importance which can be readily deduced from a previous, more notable statement.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}[The Proposition Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: A proposition is a central concept in the philosophy of language, semantics, logic, and related fields, often characterized as the primary bearer of truth or falsity.
\end{proposition}

\begin{postulate}[The Postulate Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: A postulate is a statement everyone agrees to be correct.
\end{postulate}

\begin{axiom}[The Axiom Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From WikipediA: An axiom is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}[The Remark Environment]\leavevmode\newline
    From Math StackExchange: The remark device is used for material that is is too long to be included in parentheses, while it deserves greater prominence than a footnote.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    From Cambridge Dictionary: The example is a way of helping someone to understand something by showing them how it is used.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}
    From Springer: A problem is generally considered to be a task, a situation, or person which is difficult to deal with or control due to complexity and intransparency.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
\end{solution}
